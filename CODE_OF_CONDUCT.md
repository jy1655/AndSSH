## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct and may take any action they deem appropriate in response to behavior
that violates this policy.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public interactions
when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Enforcement

To report unacceptable behavior, contact project maintainers through a direct
maintainer contact channel. If no private channel is available, open an issue
with minimal personal details and request a private follow-up. All reports will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
