## Reporting a vulnerability

If you found a potential vulnerability, please do not post it publicly first.

Preferred reporting path:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories (private report) for this repository.
2. Include as much detail as possible:
   - affected commit or version
   - device model / Android version
   - reproduction steps
   - logs, stack traces, and proof-of-concept if available
3. If private advisory is not available, contact maintainers directly and open a
   public issue only after a fix is ready.

## Response targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage update: within 7 days
- Fix and disclosure timeline: depends on severity and reproducibility

## Disclosure

After a fix is available, maintainers may publish:

- impact summary
- affected versions
- mitigation steps
- fix reference (commit/release)
