# AndSSH Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-25

AndSSH is an open-source Android SSH client application.

This Privacy Policy explains what data is handled by the app and how it is used.

## 1. Summary

- AndSSH does not operate a cloud backend.
- AndSSH does not collect analytics, advertising identifiers, or user-tracking data for the developer.
- Data you enter in the app is primarily stored on your device.

## 2. Data Processed by the App

Depending on features you use, the app may process:

- SSH/SFTP connection profiles (host, port, username, options)
- Authentication material you provide (passwords, private keys, certificates, passphrases)
- Terminal usage data stored locally (command history, snippets, app preferences)
- Local encrypted backups you export/import
- Local crash logs stored on device

## 3. Data Storage

- Connection/profile and sensitive settings data are stored locally on device.
- Sensitive data is protected using Android security mechanisms (including Android Keystore where applicable).
- No developer-controlled remote database is used by AndSSH.

## 4. Network Behavior

AndSSH connects to:

- Servers/endpoints that you configure (for SSH/SFTP sessions and related features)
- Platform services required for app distribution/update and optional Android platform capabilities

Server operators you connect to may collect logs on their side according to their own policies. Those systems are outside AndSSH developer control.

## 5. Data Sharing

AndSSH does not sell personal data.

Data is only shared when you explicitly trigger an action, such as:

- sharing an exported key
- sharing/exporting a backup
- connecting to remote servers you configured

## 6. Retention and Deletion

- Data remains on your device until you delete it.
- You can remove profiles, keys, backups, and logs from within the app.
- Uninstalling the app removes app sandbox data according to Android behavior.

## 7. Security

We apply reasonable safeguards, including local encryption and secure storage features provided by Android. However, no method of storage or transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## 8. Children

AndSSH is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the app evolves. The "Last updated" date above indicates the current version.
